// Pinky, the Over-Eager Ambusher
// Tries to cut Pac-Man off by aiming four squares ahead of him.

REPEAT every turn
    LET target ← the square four steps in front of Pac-Man’s current facing
    IF Pinky can reach target WITHOUT passing through a wall by moving horizontally first
        Face horizontally towards the target
    OTHERWISE
        Face vertically towards the target
    ENDIF
    IF the way ahead is blocked
        Turn RIGHT until it is clear   // keeps circling walls clockwise
    ENDIF
    TAKE one step
END REPEAT
